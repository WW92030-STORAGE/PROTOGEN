# PROTOGEN
Welcome to https://github.com/WW92030-STORAGE/PROTOGEN! Whether you were approached at a Furry convention, read the lore in the Furry Friends wiki, or if this is the result of numerous futile attempts at making a Protogen yourself, we welcome you. This document will be a guide to help you get started. This is, essentially, a tutorial on making a Protogen visor in a CAD software using only the most basic skills. But you can simply call this some documentation. This new project promises challenge, intrigue, and endless opportunities. Feel free to read through the tutorial documentation or simply download the STLs.
