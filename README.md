# PROTOGEN
Protogen head created in Fusion 360 from scratch but based on existing designs. Intended for use with 64x32 LED panels with 3mm separation between LEDs.
<br/>

For examples on how to use the LED Panels: [Example Code](https://github.com/WW92030-STORAGE/ESP32_64x32P3/blob/main/THRESHOLD2X.INO).<br/>

DISCLAIMER - The models are currently untested but should theoretically work. Feel free to use these files at your own risk (i.e. as in printing and using the models, not the files themselves). If you have any questions, concerns, or suggestions, feel free to make a pull request or DM me on Discord (82589933).
